# BUREAU OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC RESOURCES FISH MONITORING

The BUREAU OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC RESOURCES FISH MONITORING
was developed to reduce time and paper consumption by creating an innovative retrieving 
mobile application possible. The proposed System will provide a hassle-free classification using the 
fish dictionary in the mobile app, as an additional feature the enumerator can also retrieve and 
save data even if without internet connection by using a Google Firebase and transmitted 
automatically to the main server (MSSQL) when the user will be able to access internet.

Currently the firebase feature not working due to inactivity.
